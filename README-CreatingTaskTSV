#Creating LEVIN task .tsvs
#Replace ### with the participant number and hit run
#For the LEVIN project, remember that the original participant numbers do not match our current participant numbers
#In addition, the task files are a bit messy. If an error gets flagged, it's because an extra fixation cross was shown during the task
  and the code tjinfant2.m should be used.
#Participant 3142s task ended early and the last video was not shown. 'NaN' was added to replace the missing value
